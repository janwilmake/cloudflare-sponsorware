# Sponsorflare - Cloudflare Middleware for easy Monetisation of a worker using GitHub Sponsors

Inspired by [sponsorware](https://github.com/sponsorware/docs) and [this blog](https://calebporzio.com/sponsorware), sponsorflare aims allowing for [cloudflare workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com) monetisation in a few lines of code.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a work in progress

## Intended usage

Installation:

1. run `npm i sponsorflare`
2. create a github oauth client at https://github.com/settings/applications/new with the right redirect URI, and get the client ID and secret
3. run `cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars`
4. run `npx wranger xxxxx` (create kv)

`wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[vars]
GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI = "https://yourworkerdomain.com/callback"
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URI = "/"`
```

`main.ts`:

```ts
import { middleware, userPaid, getLifetimeValue } from "sponsorflare";

type Env = {
  sponsorflare: KVNamespace;
  GITHUB_CLIENT_ID: string;
  GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET: string;
  GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI: string;
  LOGIN_REDIRECT_URI: string;
};

export default {
  fetch: async (request: Request, env: Env) => {
    const sponsorflare = middleware(request, env);
    if (sponsorflare) return middleware;

    // Do your worker thing!
    // and if you want to limit stuff...
    const { ltv, spent } = await getLifetimeValue(request);
    if (spent > ltv) {
      return new Response(
        "Payment required. Sponsor me! https://github.com/sponsors/janwilmake",
        { status: 402 },
      );
    }
  },
};
```

## TODO

1. ✅ Create a standalone repo called `cloudflare-sponsorware` that you can just use it with your app to allow for github login, github watching sponsorship events, and keeping the KV. people can use their own github acc and cloudflare acc for this. Open source.
2. ✅ Buy sponsorflare.com and set up the repo and [tweet](https://x.com/janwilmake/status/1883493435635585198)
3. ✅ Make sponsorflare github oauth work (took just 5 minutes!) and create indended demo-layout with Deepseek (took just 1 minute)
4. Take a deep breath
5. Actually subscribe to watching sponsor events (via a waitUntil).
6. Come up with datastructure for consistent storage. It needs `type Sponsors={source,ownerId,ownerLogin,clv,spent}` for the POC.
7. Watch subscriber userId, and subscriber event, store total livetime value with money spent ensuring it makes sense. Keep that in a central KV that is reliable: we need probably D1 for consistency.
