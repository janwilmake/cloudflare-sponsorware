# Sponsorflare - Cloudflare Middleware for easy Monetisation of a worker using GitHub Sponsors

Inspired by [sponsorware](https://github.com/sponsorware/docs) and [this blog](https://calebporzio.com/sponsorware), sponsorflare aims allowing for [cloudflare workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com) monetisation in a few lines of code.

> This is a work in progress

## Intended usage

Installation:

1. run `cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars`
2. create a github oauth client at https://github.com/settings/applications/new with the right redirect URI, and get the client ID and secret
3. accept sponsors at your github account. you first need to be approved
4. once accepted, go to: your sponsor dashboard -> webhook -> add webhook
   1. URL: one of your workers at `/github-webhook`
   2. add a secret that you save to `.dev.vars`
   3. content type: JSON
5. run `npm i sponsorflare`
6. run `npx wranger xxxxx` (create kv)

`wrangler.toml`:

```toml
[vars]
GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI = "https://yourworkerdomain.com/callback"
LOGIN_REDIRECT_URI = "/"
```

`main.ts`:

```typescript
import { middleware, userPaid, getLifetimeValue } from "sponsorflare";

type Env = {
  sponsorflare: KVNamespace;
  GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET: string;
  GITHUB_CLIENT_ID: string;
  GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET: string;
  GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI: string;
  LOGIN_REDIRECT_URI: string;
};

export default {
  fetch: async (request: Request, env: Env) => {
    const sponsorflare = middleware(request, env);
    if (sponsorflare) return middleware;

    // Do your worker thing!
    // and if you want to limit stuff...
    const { isAuthenticated, login, id, isSponsor, ltv, spent } =
      await getSponsor(request, env);
    if (spent > ltv) {
      return new Response(
        "Payment required. Sponsor me! https://github.com/sponsors/janwilmake",
        { status: 402 },
      );
    }
  },
};
```

## TODO

1. ✅ Create a standalone repo called `cloudflare-sponsorware` that you can just use it with your app to allow for github login, github watching sponsorship events, and keeping the KV. people can use their own github acc and cloudflare acc for this. Open source.
2. ✅ Buy sponsorflare.com and set up the repo and [tweet](https://x.com/janwilmake/status/1883493435635585198)
3. ✅ Make sponsorflare github oauth work (took just 5 minutes!) and create indended demo-layout with Deepseek (took just 1 minute)
4. ✅ Take a deep breath. Look into the apis and find which APIs and webhooks are needed (and validate this is even possible as the way I want it).
5. ✅ Test out retrieving required information from a sponsor with matching userId.
6. ✅ Created getSponsors function.
7. Create consistent storage: D1 with `type Sponsors={source,ownerId,ownerLogin,clv,spent}` for the POC.
8. Watch sponsor event and when it happens, sync using `getSponsors` storing total livetime value with money spent ensuring it makes sense.
9. Now I can make function `getSponsor(request,env,config?:{charge?:number})` that charges and/or gets clv/spent of the current request.
